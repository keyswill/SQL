-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

-- Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

-- Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
-- Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

-- Who are the top 10 most popular artists based on average song popularity?
SELECT 
artist_name
, AVG(popularity)
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(popularity) DESC
LIMIT 10;

--- What are the average values for energy, danceability, and acousticness across all tracks?
SELECT 
ROUND (AVG(energy),3) AS avg_energy
, ROUND (AVG(danceability),3) AS avg_danceability
, ROUND (AVG(acousticness), 3) AS avg_acousticness
FROM spotifydata
WHERE track_name IS NOT NULL;

-- Which artists tend to produce high-energy and low-acousticness tracks?
SELECT 
artist_name
,AVG(energy) AS avg_energy
, AVG(acousticness) AS avg_acousticness
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING AVG(energy) > 0.75 AND AVG(acousticness) < 0.3
ORDER BY avg_energy DESC, avg_acousticness ASC;

-- What is the average duration and popularity of the songs in the dataset?
SELECT 
ROUND(AVG(duration_ms / 60000),3) AS avg_duration_min
, ROUND(AVG(popularity),3) AS avg_popularity
FROM spotifydata;

-- Which key is most commonly used in popular songs?
SELECT 
key
, COUNT(id) AS num_of_songs
FROM spotifydata
WHERE key IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY key
ORDER BY num_of_songs DESC;

-- What is the average speechiness, acousticness and instrumentalness of the songs in the dataset
SELECT
ROUND(AVG(speechiness),3) AS avg_speechiness
, ROUND(AVG(acousticness),3) AS avg_acousticness
, ROUND(AVG(instrumentalness),3) AS avg_instrumentalness
FROM spotifydata;
