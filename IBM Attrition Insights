## SQL queries
-- Overall attrition rate 
SELECT 
  ROUND(CAST(SUM(CASE 
      WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS attrition_rate_percent
FROM Emp_attrition
;

-- Department attrition rate
SELECT 
  Department
  , ROUND(CAST(SUM(CASE 
      WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS attrition_rate_percent
FROM Emp_attrition
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY attrition_rate_percent DESC
;

-- Average monthly income by job role
SELECT JobRole
, ROUND(AVG(MonthlyIncome), 2) AS avg_monthly_income
FROM Emp_attrition
GROUP BY JobRole
ORDER BY avg_monthly_income DESC
;

-- Job satisfaction by department
SELECT Department
    , ROUND(AVG(JobSatisfaction),2) AS department_job_satisfaction
FROM Emp_attrition
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY department_job_satisfaction DESC
;

-- Average tenure by attrition status
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' 
      THEN YearsAtCompany 
      ELSE NULL END), 2) 
      AS avg_tenure_attrition_yes,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'No' 
      THEN YearsAtCompany 
      ELSE NULL END), 2) 
      AS avg_tenure_attrition_no
FROM Emp_attrition
